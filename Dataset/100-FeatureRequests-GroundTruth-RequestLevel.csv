This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messagesÂ #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)?

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )"

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number."

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places."

The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these.
