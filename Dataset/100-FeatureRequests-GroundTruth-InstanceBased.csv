However, since the messages are transported either via SMS or via Google Cloud Messaging, both of which don't guarantee ordering, messages may appear in the wrong order. This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messagesÂ #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)?

The idea is, that the user understands that there might be a little risk in opening or saving an attached image, but doesn't want to see this warning again and again.

Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns. People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number.",No Defect Found,N/a,N/a,N/a,N/a,N/a,N/a,N/a,N/a
