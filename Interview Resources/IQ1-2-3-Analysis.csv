,IQ1. Developer's Challenges,,IQ2. Developer's Approach toward Handling Defects,,,IQ3. Impact of Defects,
Participants,"IQ1.1. As a developer, what recurring challenges or common ""defects"" do you frequently encounter in feature requests?",IQ1.2.How do you perceive ambiguity and incompleteness as challeneges in feature requests?,"IQ2.1. As a developer, what steps do you take when encountering ambiguous or incomplete requests? ",IQ2.2. What types of questions do you ask to clarify defects?,IQ2.3. How has your approach toward addressing defects changed or evolved over time?,IQ3.1. How do defects in requests affect your ability to proceed with the work?,"IQ3.2. How do you perceive defects as impacting downstream software engineering tasks (e.g., design, implementation, and testing)?"
P1,Lack of details; Missing information,Result in waste of time,depends on where the request come from: If the request is random from a requester and not given proper details developer will discard else: Ask questions for more details through line of communication. ,Ask question for about the context; Questions related to reproducing the problem,NA,"Wasting time, redoing the work",All downstream tasks
P2,Missing information; Unclear User Intent and Goals; Lack of Prioritization and Impact Assessment; Unknown target audience; Misalignment with Product Strategy and Mission; lack of requirements Validation and prototyping,Results in inefficiency. Solution: use cases or technical feasibility,Ask questions for more details; Prototyping - specically for UI,"""how did this need come up?"" ""how did you figure out you need this specific feature?""; ""Who is the user that wants this specific feature?"", ""What were the issues that led to this specific feature request?"", ""Is there another way that you can solve the issue?""",NA,"Wasting time, demotivating, causing lack of trust between the team members, affecting the morale of the team.",NA
P3,"Missing information; lack of template with a specific format; Lack of Cross-Referencing with Existing Features; Misalignment with Product Strategy and Mission, Lack of Continuity and Commitment in Open-Source Development",Results in multiple ways for implementation,Ask questions for more details,"Asking for use cases that help requesters articulate their need; ""how this new feature would be useful?""; Discussing conflicts with the philosophy of the project; Discussion on why their suggested approach may not work",NA,"Inefficient, losing traction, avoiding implementation, increase in the number of disorganized open issues. ",NA
P4,The requester's lack of knowledge about the technial implementation details;  Lack of details; Missing information,"Results in missing implementation details, missing edge cases ",Ask questions for more details; brainstorm,"""What is the work process?""; ""What it should work like?""; ""What it should look like?""",Initially started with implementing but moved to clarification so that it is less redo work. ,"Inconsistencies between viewpoints, follow ups and dissatisfaction with the product",Testing
P5,Lack of details; ambiguity,Results in missing implementation details,Analyze; Ask questions  for more details,"""How the application would work for positive and negative case?"" ""For different cases how it behaves?"" ""How the new case came in the middle of development?""",NA,Cause confusion,"Testing, deployment"
P6,Lack of details; Unclear User Intent and Goals,They are caused by lack of details and missing information about the requester's goal,Ask questions for more details,"""What is the problem you are trying to solve?"";  What do you see?""; ""What will this enable that was not there before?"" ",Initially started with implementing but moved to clarification to address software maintenance issues. ,Taking extra time,"Testing, maintenance"
P7,Lack of details; missing information,Results in Multiple Interpretation; missing implementation details; missing use case,Ask questions for more details,"""Why do you want this feature?""; ""Where do you use the feature?""; ""Can you show some examples so I can understand what you want?""; ""What is a specific use case?""; ""What is the platform you're using?""; ""Can you provide an example of how you can use it?""; ""can you provide some steps specifiying what you will do?"";  Can you provide logs of what's happening or screenshots, or video of what's happening?",Being more relaxed regarding addressing the feature requests,NA- It is a known risk to open source GitHub projects. ,Testing
