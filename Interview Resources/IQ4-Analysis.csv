IQ,Analysis of Three Feature Requests,,
Sub IQ,"IQ4.1. What are your initial thoughts on this feature request? 
IQ4.2. If this was an actual feature request assigned to you, what would be your first steps for implementation? 
IQ4.3. How would you go about clarifying ambiguous or missing parts of the request?

P1,"Q1: The feature request is clear regarding what the requester wants and the final delivery results. But there are various ways that a developer can implement this request. Q2 and Q3: I would ask ""elaborate why or how the feature request will be usefull"", ""what value does this feature add to the software?"". It is not clear what"" nasty things"" is reffring to. Considering the amount of resources that is required to implement this feature request, the developing team needs to make sure it is actually worth it (cost - benefit analysis and identifying the priorities) and whether it fits within the scope of the project. ",The feature request is clear. It is clear what is being asked and it seems to fit within the scope of the project. ,There's not even anything that's being requested. It seems someone is communicating their opinion in an incomplete way. There is nothing to implement here. 
P2,"Q1: who the potential user is and what problem they're trying to solve?, There is no use case scenario with this request. Also the value proposition is missing from the request. The wording also is not clear what ""nasty things"" are. Q2: As a developer, I have to guess the use case scenario and rewrite the request in the way that the scenario is covered. Also analyze whether this request is within the value proposition or scope of the software. This feature is not easy to implement and it is not clear what value it will add and what the user wants protection against (lack of use case scenario). ","Q1: ""Why do you need this feature?"" ""What is the goal?""; Q2: Look up certain technical details, such as ""SMS delivery report"" and check the code base. Read the Ui code and search the labels. ",Q1: Ask for screenshots or videos that shows what the requester means because it is not clear what they want. Ask for step by step guide how to reproduce the issue. Q2: Try to reproduce the issue based on the step by step scenario. 
P3,"Q1: The request is brief and open to interpretations. The word ""private"" can mean different things, such as no external network access or encrypted storage. It is not clear how this feature will work technically. The whole request is open to interpretations. Does it mean that signal needs to build its own in-app Pdf renderer or do Pdfs need to be open in a separate sandbox? Signal is not a document viewer. So the scope and priority of this request can be questioned. Also the implementing this feature is difficult. It is not clear why this feature is useful. Q2: Ask the requester for clarification about the scope (cross platform), about how it is going to work. I will also check if any request like this has been submitted on GitHub before. Consult with other developers on Github about the main objectives of Signal and whether this request alligns with those objectives. Q3: The request is simply articulated, but technical specifications are missing.  The word ""private"" can mean different things, such as no external network access or encrypted storage. ","Q1: Unclear scope and lack of details. Q2: Ask clarifying questions and think about the risks this new feature can introduce to the software since it is about timestamps. Q3: ""recieve time"" is ambigious and can have multiple interpretations if the message is delayed. Maybe the message is sent to two parties or group message, then what should be the recived time?, Where should the recive time be placed in the UI with respect to other timestamps?","Q1: The requeust is articulated poorly and is difficult to understand what the request wants and means. It is not clear if the requester is complaining about the visuals of UI or the functionality.  Q2: It is difficult to invest time and identify what the requester wants.  Q3: ""Nonsense"" seems to be missing an English word here. ""Regular Menu"", what does the request mean by ""Regular Menu""? ""What is ""OP""?"
P4,Q1: The request can be understood. But there are certain questions that should be answered. It is missing how the feature should look like and how the user can utilize this feature if implemented. Q2: Follow up with the requester since. Q3: NA,"Q1: It is an understanble feature request, despite the fact that it is not properly formatted. Q2: Going through the code and check the UI to see how to implement this feature. Also checking the service interaction and the API. Q3: Missing information about the UI design. ","Q1: Does this feature request have a screenshot attached to it? The feature request is missing the context. Q2: Asking for screenshots from the requester and checking the UI design in details. Q3: Terms like ""Sliding panel"" or ""regular menu"" can have multiple meanings and can refer to different components. "
P5,"Q1: Is it possible to view the file from the sender if the receiver is not connect to the Internet? And if it is possible, maybe what kind of mechanisms are out there that will make it possible to review a document offline. Q2: Explore other messaging apps and look for similar features. Explore options regarding the Internet connextivity. Q3: The request is incomplete regarding alternative scenarios with or without Internet. Also ""nasty thing"" is not clear. ",Q1: This feature is implemented on Whatsapp. The request is clear. Q2: Explore about how technically we can implement this feature request. Q3: The request is clear. ,Q1: I don't understand the feature request. It is confusing. It needs screenshots to understand the request and its details. Q2: Ask for the screenshot. 
P6,"Q1: Given that Signal is a privacy app, the general intent behind thsi request is clear. The feature request lacks some information. Q2: Follow up and ask specific questions about details of the PDF viewer, its functionaities, and UI design. Ask for specific use cases. Q3: Missing information. ""Other nasty things"" is vague. ","Q1: Language barrier can be seen in the feature request. Also not sure if the request can be implemented due to technical complications of SMS. Q2: Ask for clarifications or rewording, and how the UI should look like.  Q3: ""done date"" can be interpretted in different ways. Check for technical feasibility. ","Q1: The request is difficult to understand without knowing the UI. It requires the context. Q2: Asking clarifying questions on what the requester wants exactly and suggestions on how it could be designed in the UI. Ask questions about the potential users of the menu. Q3: ""Sliding panel"" and ""regular menu"" are not clear. "
P7,"Q1: There is a risk to bloating Signal. There should be analysis on the scope of the project and whether adding this feature is alligned with the mission and scope of Signal. There should be also security risk analysis for this new feature. Analyzing the alternatives to implementing pdf viewer. Q2: identiying the priority of this requested feature and analyzing the risk and alternatives. Q3: ""nasty things"" is ambigious and depends on the threat model.  ","Q1: First thought, it seems the SMS timestamps already exist. Q2: Check what are the timestamps that are already available in the app. Q3: what are the meanings of ""Delivery report"" and ""done date""? What exact time does the requester refers to in terms of delivery time, e.g., the time SMS reaches the device or when the message is opened?  ","Q1: The request is difficult to understand. Q2: Ask more details and also screenshots or videos. Q3: ""regular menu"" and ""non sense with the UI"" seem to be ambigious. "
