I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Statement: Request Number - 780 | Request Title - Deduplicate messages | Request Description - Currently TextSecure (2.0.1) can only import messages from the default Android SMS application once. Afterwards doing the same again results in duplicate messages. It would be nice to be able to deduplicate them. I assume that going through the list of messages and comparing from, to, time and text would be sufficient. Then just delete everything except the first occurance. Please excuse me, if this is a duplicate of another issue. It was hard to find good search terms, since ""duplicate"" occurs extremely often as ""duplicate of issue #..."".
