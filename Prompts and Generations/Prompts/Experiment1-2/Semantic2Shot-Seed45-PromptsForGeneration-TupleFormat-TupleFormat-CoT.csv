I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

I've noticed that Signal receives notifications on new messages and they are also listed in the notification area, but the unread notifications badge on the app icon on the home screen is not shown. In Signal support articles there is mentioned, that badge icons are supported for some launchers, see https://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/215766077-How-can-I-see-my-unread-badge-count-What-launcher-should-I-use- So far I could not find out if this is a Signal or EMUI problem, but Threema and Conversations show the notification badges. Device info. Device: Honor 8 Android version: 6.0 Signal version: 3.26.2
