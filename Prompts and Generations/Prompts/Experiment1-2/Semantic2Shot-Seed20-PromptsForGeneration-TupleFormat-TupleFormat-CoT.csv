Statement: Request Number - 6077 | Request Title - Update libphonenumber to >=8.2.0 (Cannot send SMS to my mobile provider) | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. My friend made me aware of this as I'm never checking my account status via SMS, but it doesn't work for me neither. To check our account status, we have to send an SMS message to 13977, but Signal fails to deliver it. I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce.  send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, ""Failed to send"", ""Some issues need your attention."" Expected result: Message should go through and I should get a response. Device info. Device: OnePlus3T Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 3.27.1 Link to debug log. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f656572561ea3a91d0f4bbdeb98e587b

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...).

Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network.
