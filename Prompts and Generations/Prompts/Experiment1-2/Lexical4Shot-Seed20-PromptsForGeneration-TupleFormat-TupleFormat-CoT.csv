Statement: Request Number - 1211 | Request Title - Chat scrolls when new messages are received | Request Description - When being in a chat and messages are received the chat scrolls with them to the most recent message. So when you have received something over 100 messages (like when you are in an active group chat) you have to scroll quite some time up until you reach the part you read last. It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 780 | Request Title - Deduplicate messages | Request Description - Currently TextSecure (2.0.1) can only import messages from the default Android SMS application once. Afterwards doing the same again results in duplicate messages. It would be nice to be able to deduplicate them. I assume that going through the list of messages and comparing from, to, time and text would be sufficient. Then just delete everything except the first occurance. Please excuse me, if this is a duplicate of another issue. It was hard to find good search terms, since ""duplicate"" occurs extremely often as ""duplicate of issue #..."".

Statement: Request Number - 650 | Request Title - Disable SMS only on out-of-country contacts | Request Description - This is a feature request. It would be very handy if I can enable SMS fallback only for the contacts in my country but disable them for contacts out of my country. Usually out-of-country SMS rates are quite high and can run up quite a bill if you have the feature enabled to fallback on SMS. Thanks.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

So when you have received something over 100 messages (like when you are in an active group chat) you have to scroll quite some time up until you reach the part you read last. It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

The contacts are listed, but after the first few it gets cut. you can check the details of each message sent but that's slow. Please make an option included in a bulk sms message with easily displays the currently included recipients. So I know who any future messages will be sent in bulk too. adding/removing people would be overkill.. but having a nice list would be awesome.

It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Statement: Request Number - 1211 | Request Title - Chat scrolls when new messages are received | Request Description - When being in a chat and messages are received the chat scrolls with them to the most recent message. So when you have received something over 100 messages (like when you are in an active group chat) you have to scroll quite some time up until you reach the part you read last. It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

So when you have received something over 100 messages (like when you are in an active group chat) you have to scroll quite some time up until you reach the part you read last. It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

My friend made me aware of this as I'm never checking my account status via SMS, but it doesn't work for me neither. To check our account status, we have to send an SMS message to 13977, but Signal fails to deliver it. I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce.  send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, ""Failed to send"", ""Some issues need your attention."" Expected result: Message should go through and I should get a response. Device info. Device: OnePlus3T Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 3.27.1 Link to debug log. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f656572561ea3a91d0f4bbdeb98e587b
