Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Statement: Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

For 3 of these, I did not get a confirmation that they have been delivered. It would be nice if messages are automatically resent if no delivery confirmation is received. Especially, if later messages to the same recipient do get a delivery confirmation, indicating that the recipient is reachable again.

Statement: Request Number - 1211 | Request Title - Chat scrolls when new messages are received | Request Description - When being in a chat and messages are received the chat scrolls with them to the most recent message. So when you have received something over 100 messages (like when you are in an active group chat) you have to scroll quite some time up until you reach the part you read last. It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

I've installed Signal on a Honor 8 (made by Huawei) with EMUI 4.1 (Android 6.0). I've noticed that Signal receives notifications on new messages and they are also listed in the notification area, but the unread notifications badge on the app icon on the home screen is not shown. In Signal support articles there is mentioned, that badge icons are supported for some launchers, see https://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/215766077-How-can-I-see-my-unread-badge-count-What-launcher-should-I-use- So far I could not find out if this is a Signal or EMUI problem, but Threema and Conversations show the notification badges.

Statement: Request Number - 6013 | Request Title - Feature Request: Disappearing Message Time of 15 Minutes | Request Description - The disappearing message function is something that I make heavy use of, but there seems to be a gap in the options. When thinking about how long some conversations go, 5 minutes seems too quick, but 30 minutes is too long. I'd love for there to be a 15 minute option. Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc).

Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes.

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc).

When opening ""Image gallery"" (or lateron media gallery due to #5941 ) I would like to be able to multiselect images/media and delete them. And when opening an image/media, I would like to have the possibility to delete it in this opened view. Maybe putting this option behind a settings menu as the action bar already contains forward, save, All Images. (In Gallery mode only save). IMO there should be a dialog, if you really want to delete this (all the selected images).  One point to think about is the corresponding messaged (text). At the moment, it's only possible to delete the whole messagte (text + image/media) by selecting it right in the conversation. When deleting in the gallery mode or when opened, the corresponding text is not visible to the user, so maybe it should be contained (with a hint to the deleted image/media)?

Statement: Request Number - 6013 | Request Title - Feature Request: Disappearing Message Time of 15 Minutes | Request Description - The disappearing message function is something that I make heavy use of, but there seems to be a gap in the options. When thinking about how long some conversations go, 5 minutes seems too quick, but 30 minutes is too long. I'd love for there to be a 15 minute option. Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol.

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

(As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

My friend made me aware of this as I'm never checking my account status via SMS, but it doesn't work for me neither. To check our account status, we have to send an SMS message to 13977, but Signal fails to deliver it. I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce.  send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, ""Failed to send"", ""Some issues need your attention.""

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

When opening ""Image gallery"" (or lateron media gallery due to #5941 ) I would like to be able to multiselect images/media and delete them. And when opening an image/media, I would like to have the possibility to delete it in this opened view. Maybe putting this option behind a settings menu as the action bar already contains forward, save, All Images. (In Gallery mode only save). IMO there should be a dialog, if you really want to delete this (all the selected images).  One point to think about is the corresponding messaged (text). At the moment, it's only possible to delete the whole messagte (text + image/media) by selecting it right in the conversation. When deleting in the gallery mode or when opened, the corresponding text is not visible to the user, so maybe it should be contained (with a hint to the deleted image/media)?

Statement: Request Number - 6013 | Request Title - Feature Request: Disappearing Message Time of 15 Minutes | Request Description - The disappearing message function is something that I make heavy use of, but there seems to be a gap in the options. When thinking about how long some conversations go, 5 minutes seems too quick, but 30 minutes is too long. I'd love for there to be a 15 minute option. Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace.

Statement: Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Every time I view the post from different from the timeline, I can feel they are all alive, not only me. Every time, every second, I can meet new friend, maybe he is in Japan, having dinner, or In French. Now the feature of viewing from timeline is not in mastondon-android.

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

When opening ""Image gallery"" (or lateron media gallery due to #5941 ) I would like to be able to multiselect images/media and delete them. And when opening an image/media, I would like to have the possibility to delete it in this opened view. Maybe putting this option behind a settings menu as the action bar already contains forward, save, All Images. (In Gallery mode only save). IMO there should be a dialog, if you really want to delete this (all the selected images).  One point to think about is the corresponding messaged (text). At the moment, it's only possible to delete the whole messagte (text + image/media) by selecting it right in the conversation. When deleting in the gallery mode or when opened, the corresponding text is not visible to the user, so maybe it should be contained (with a hint to the deleted image/media)?
