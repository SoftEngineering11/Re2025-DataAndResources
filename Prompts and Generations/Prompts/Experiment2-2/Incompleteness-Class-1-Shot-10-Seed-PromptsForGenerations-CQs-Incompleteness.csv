Statement: Request Number - 2285 | Request Title - Send button should stick to last method (Signal, insecure SMS) on a per-user basis | Request Description - What it says on the tin; taken from discussion at the bottom of #845 . As @samlanning mentioned and other users indicated, the send method must currently be selected with every message with a chat partner. ""Stickiness"" would be helpful, as long as the Send button reflected it visually (including for color-impaired users). Implementing this would also be a workaround to #845 itself.

Reason: The request indicates an indicator should be used without specifying the type and appearance of indicator. The request also suggests a different behavior for a button that currently opens a selection menu without indicating how the selection menu should be accessed afterward. The word 'user' is also provided without reference index, making it unclear if the user is the sender or receiver. A developer may need to know the author's expectations for these behaviors to accurately implement their request.

Statement: Request Number - 2285 | Request Title - Send button should stick to last method (Signal, insecure SMS) on a per-user basis | Request Description - What it says on the tin; taken from discussion at the bottom of #845 . As @samlanning mentioned and other users indicated, the send method must currently be selected with every message with a chat partner. ""Stickiness"" would be helpful, as long as the Send button reflected it visually (including for color-impaired users). Implementing this would also be a workaround to #845 itself.

Reason: The request indicates an indicator should be used without specifying the type and appearance of indicator. The request also suggests a different behavior for a button that currently opens a selection menu without indicating how the selection menu should be accessed afterward. The word 'user' is also provided without reference index, making it unclear if the user is the sender or receiver. A developer may need to know the author's expectations for these behaviors to accurately implement their request.

Reason: The request indicates an indicator should be used without specifying the type and appearance of indicator. The request also suggests a different behavior for a button that currently opens a selection menu without indicating how the selection menu should be accessed afterward.

A developer may need to know the author's expectations for these behaviors to accurately implement their request.

Request Number - 176 | Request Title - Feature: Automatic deletion of old messages | Request Description - In the spirit of https://ssd.eff.org/your-computer/protect/retention having deletion of messages older than a certain amount is probably good practice. I previously used an automated tool to delete SMS messages older than 30 days, but since TextSecure uses its own database, this no longer works. Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.
