I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

And when opening an image/media, I would like to have the possibility to delete it in this opened view. Maybe putting this option behind a settings menu as the action bar already contains forward, save, All Images. (In Gallery mode only save). IMO there should be a dialog, if you really want to delete this (all the selected images).  One point to think about is the corresponding messaged (text). At the moment, it's only possible to delete the whole messagte (text + image/media) by selecting it right in the conversation. When deleting in the gallery mode or when opened, the corresponding text is not visible to the user, so maybe it should be contained (with a hint to the deleted image/media)?

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

I previously used an automated tool to delete SMS messages older than 30 days, but since TextSecure uses its own database, this no longer works. Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 7567 | Request Title - [Feature Request] SMS/Signal Notifications profile | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. When making Signal as default SMS manager, there is no way to have default SMS notification (Android settings) to be enforced and having the Signal notification settings just for Signal message/call only. Steps to reproduce.  Install Signal and enable SMS support. Actual result: The same Expected result: Use Android notification profile for regular SMS/MMS and use Signal settings for secure messages / call. I use Signal with a limited number of people and I wish to know the difference between regular SMS or secured one by the ringtone (secure messages are mostly more urgent than other SMS). Screenshots. Device info. Device: BlackBerry Motion Android version: 7.1.2 Signal version: 4.16.9 Link to debug log.

Statement: Request Number - 312 | Request Title - Need Batch Selection Mode for individual messages inside a conversation | Request Description - Deleting individual messages from a conversation is cumbersome and inefficient (Hold down on a message, then select Delete from popup menu, then select Yes on confirmation message, one message at a time). By way of contrast, holding down on a conversation in the Conversations list initiates Batch Selection Mode, allowing user to select multiple conversations for an action (currently Delete is the only option). Being able to trim out fluff from a conversation but keep important messages would be a valuable feature. A similar Batch Selection Mode for individual messages within a conversation (as already exists in the default Android Text Message app) would provide this functionality.
