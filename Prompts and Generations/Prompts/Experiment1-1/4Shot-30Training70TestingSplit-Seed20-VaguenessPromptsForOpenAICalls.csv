Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Statement: Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.

Statement: Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 969 | Request Title - Color incoming messages in groups according to author | Request Description - Since there's so many UX experts around lately, I want to propose this: In groups, I always find it kind of annoying to have to read the name of the sender of a message. Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

Statement: Request Number - 6424 | Request Title - Improve search for non-contacts | Request Description - We recently made some improvements in Signal-iOS around searching for non-contacts by phone number.  I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

That's what e.g. WhatsApp does with its blue checkmarks. However I would like to use ""manual read receipts"" in the manner Threema has implemented them (they call it ""acknowledge""): Long-press a received message Select ""acknowledge message"" (I guess so, I use the german translation) Then the ""received"" (or ""seen"") indicator is replaced by an indicator for acknowledgement of the message I choose this to say that I read something over writing ""Ok."" because it doesn't annoy my conversation partner. Most of the time it's sufficient that the partner gets this information the next time he opens Signal and not immediately.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Statement: Request Number - 6390 | Request Title - Notify sender if Signal message has been sent but not delivered to recipient after some time | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

Both Chomp SMS and Handcent SMS have this excellent feature. Delay options from 1 to 5 seconds should be enough. Thanks!

I previously used an automated tool to delete SMS messages older than 30 days, but since TextSecure uses its own database, this no longer works. Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.

The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! üéâ"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Statement: Request Number - 6424 | Request Title - Improve search for non-contacts | Request Description - We recently made some improvements in Signal-iOS around searching for non-contacts by phone number.  I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Statement: Request Number - 4821 | Request Title - Manual read receipts | Request Description - I am aware of your view on (automatic) read receipts from #2667 . That's what e.g. WhatsApp does with its blue checkmarks. However I would like to use ""manual read receipts"" in the manner Threema has implemented them (they call it ""acknowledge""): Long-press a received message Select ""acknowledge message"" (I guess so, I use the german translation) Then the ""received"" (or ""seen"") indicator is replaced by an indicator for acknowledgement of the message I choose this to say that I read something over writing ""Ok."" because it doesn't annoy my conversation partner. Most of the time it's sufficient that the partner gets this information the next time he opens Signal and not immediately.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

It's quite common to see non-passphrase users wonder why screenshots in Signal don't work. It probably doesn't make sense to have Screen security enabled by default for them. For passphrase users it makes sense. One option would be to remove the feature completely from settings and make it an implicit feature which depends on the passphrase setting. In #1431 (comment) moxie0 wrote: [The Screen security feature i]s not designed to prevent screenshots, it's designed to notify the task manager that it shouldn't cache screenshots of conversations. The side effect is that it prevents screenshots.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Statement: Request Number - 6390 | Request Title - Notify sender if Signal message has been sent but not delivered to recipient after some time | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

This would go a long way in making the app more friendly for the less tech-enthusiastic users and those, who don't want to crawl through the settings-menu. edit: corrected formatting.

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites.

Statement: Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Statement: Request Number - 6459 | Request Title - Feature Request: Use Share Intent Subject When Sharing to Signal | Request Description - At the moment, sending a share Intent to Signal will include the EXTRA_TEXT portion of the Intent but not the EXTRA_SUBJECT For example, using this code from another app Intent sendIntent = new Intent (); sendIntent . setAction ( Intent .

EXTRA_TEXT , ""This is the intent body"" ); sendIntent . setType ( ""text/plain"" ); startActivity ( Intent . createChooser ( sendIntent , getResources (). getText ( R . string . send_to ))); Signal will only use the body: ""This is the intent body"" but not use the subject: ""This is the intent title"" This would make it easier to get page titles and other subjects shared from browsers and other apps that set the share Intent's EXTRA_SUBJECT

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 969 | Request Title - Color incoming messages in groups according to author | Request Description - Since there's so many UX experts around lately, I want to propose this: In groups, I always find it kind of annoying to have to read the name of the sender of a message. Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Statement: Request Number - 6424 | Request Title - Improve search for non-contacts | Request Description - We recently made some improvements in Signal-iOS around searching for non-contacts by phone number.  I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

But deleting the thread does not remove me from a group, but until someone writes to that group or updates it, i am not able to write to that group, as i have no open thread i could select. I propose: thread deletion for groups should just clear all messages without removing the group from the thread list

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Statement: Request Number - 6390 | Request Title - Notify sender if Signal message has been sent but not delivered to recipient after some time | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

This way one could see when the other user received the message (not only that is was received). edit: if someone can give me a hint where to look/start in the code to implement this, I'd try to make a pull request (but I just glanced through the code and cannot find a starting point ... maybe it's simply too late already ;-))

I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce.  send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, ""Failed to send"", ""Some issues need your attention.""

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 969 | Request Title - Color incoming messages in groups according to author | Request Description - Since there's so many UX experts around lately, I want to propose this: In groups, I always find it kind of annoying to have to read the name of the sender of a message. Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

As @samlanning mentioned and other users indicated, the send method must currently be selected with every message with a chat partner. ""Stickiness"" would be helpful, as long as the Send button reflected it visually (including for color-impaired users). Implementing this would also be a workaround to #845 itself.

Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time.

Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 77 | Request Title - Display all recipients for group thread. | Request Description - After creating a bulk message, the recipients are not easily listed anywhere. The contacts are listed, but after the first few it gets cut. you can check the details of each message sent but that's slow. Please make an option included in a bulk sms message with easily displays the currently included recipients. So I know who any future messages will be sent in bulk too. adding/removing people would be overkill.. but having a nice list would be awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

When thinking about how long some conversations go, 5 minutes seems too quick, but 30 minutes is too long. I'd love for there to be a 15 minute option. Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

Statement: Request Number - 6077 | Request Title - Update libphonenumber to >=8.2.0 (Cannot send SMS to my mobile provider) | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. My friend made me aware of this as I'm never checking my account status via SMS, but it doesn't work for me neither. To check our account status, we have to send an SMS message to 13977, but Signal fails to deliver it. I tried sending it through the native Oneplus SMS app and it goes through just fine, with an immediate response. I can send an SMS to other people, though, so it has something to do with that number. (Signal adds +385 to it for Croatia, maybe that's it?) Steps to reproduce.  send an SMS to my provider through Signal Actual result: it doesn't go through, ""Failed to send"", ""Some issues need your attention."" Expected result: Message should go through and I should get a response. Device info. Device: OnePlus3T Android version: 7.0 Signal version: 3.27.1 Link to debug log. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f656572561ea3a91d0f4bbdeb98e587b

Statement: Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.
