Statement: Request Number - 6013 | Request Title - Feature Request: Disappearing Message Time of 15 Minutes | Request Description - The disappearing message function is something that I make heavy use of, but there seems to be a gap in the options. When thinking about how long some conversations go, 5 minutes seems too quick, but 30 minutes is too long. I'd love for there to be a 15 minute option. Given some of the feature requests I saw while looking to see if someone else asked for 15 minutes, it might be smart to support a custom time option somewhere.

I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately!

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Statement: Request Number - 5775 | Request Title - Add longer-term disappearing timeouts | Request Description - I have looked at all open and closed issues containing ""disappearing"" here and in the libsignal-java repo. I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

It often happens that I want to share some pics with someone (more than just one pic), and I have to select them one at a time instead of selecting them all and sending them all at once. It would be cool if I could pick them from the gallery and then click ""share"" and send them without going through the procedure n times. I don't think this should be hard to implement and it would save so much time and improve usability greatly. Thank you

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI.

Statement: Request Number - 2098 | Request Title - Automatically resend undelivered messages | Request Description - Since the delivery confirmation functionality has been implemented, I sent 48 messages. For 3 of these, I did not get a confirmation that they have been delivered. It would be nice if messages are automatically resent if no delivery confirmation is received. Especially, if later messages to the same recipient do get a delivery confirmation, indicating that the recipient is reachable again.

Statement: Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Statement: Request Number - 780 | Request Title - Deduplicate messages | Request Description - Currently TextSecure (2.0.1) can only import messages from the default Android SMS application once. Afterwards doing the same again results in duplicate messages. It would be nice to be able to deduplicate them. I assume that going through the list of messages and comparing from, to, time and text would be sufficient. Then just delete everything except the first occurance. Please excuse me, if this is a duplicate of another issue. It was hard to find good search terms, since ""duplicate"" occurs extremely often as ""duplicate of issue #..."".

When opening ""Image gallery"" (or lateron media gallery due to #5941 ) I would like to be able to multiselect images/media and delete them. And when opening an image/media, I would like to have the possibility to delete it in this opened view. Maybe putting this option behind a settings menu as the action bar already contains forward, save, All Images. (In Gallery mode only save). IMO there should be a dialog, if you really want to delete this (all the selected images).  One point to think about is the corresponding messaged (text). At the moment, it's only possible to delete the whole messagte (text + image/media) by selecting it right in the conversation. When deleting in the gallery mode or when opened, the corresponding text is not visible to the user, so maybe it should be contained (with a hint to the deleted image/media)?

Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

EXTRA_TEXT , ""This is the intent body"" ); sendIntent . setType ( ""text/plain"" ); startActivity ( Intent . createChooser ( sendIntent , getResources (). getText ( R . string . send_to ))); Signal will only use the body: ""This is the intent body"" but not use the subject: ""This is the intent title"" This would make it easier to get page titles and other subjects shared from browsers and other apps that set the share Intent's EXTRA_SUBJECT
