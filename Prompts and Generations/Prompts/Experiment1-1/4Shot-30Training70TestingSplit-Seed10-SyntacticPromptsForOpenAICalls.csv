Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 328 | Request Title - Feature request: Sending dummy short messages | Request Description - TextSecure could mask meaningful communication between people by occasionally sending dummy random messages to random recipients at random times:  Recipients would be chosen randomly between contacts that knowingly use TextSecure, so it could be recognized as such after decryption and automatically discarded by recipient. ""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns. People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number.

Statement: Request Number - 937 | Request Title - Conversation View: Consistent message order | Request Description - Please correct me, but as far as I can tell, messages are sorted by time of arrival. However, since the messages are transported either via SMS or via Google Cloud Messaging, both of which don't guarantee ordering, messages may appear in the wrong order. This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messages #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)? Idea 2: Give each message a sequence number generated by the TextSecure server. Sort conversation view according to those numbers. Problem: Many, but not all messages go through the TS server. Idea 3: Employ vector clocks.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites.

It often happens that I want to share some pics with someone (more than just one pic), and I have to select them one at a time instead of selecting them all and sending them all at once. It would be cool if I could pick them from the gallery and then click ""share"" and send them without going through the procedure n times. I don't think this should be hard to implement and it would save so much time and improve usability greatly. Thank you

Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.

I previously used an automated tool to delete SMS messages older than 30 days, but since TextSecure uses its own database, this no longer works. Having the option for TextSecure to delete messages older than X (reuse of the passphrase timeout selector would be fine) would be highly helpful.

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

A swiped away notification of a received SMS is displayed back after some time. Steps to reproduce.  Receive an SMS Without opening Signal, swipe away the new notification from the Android notification drawer Actual result: After some time the same notification is displayed back. I cannot tell exactly when. Maybe it is event related. Expected result: The notification should not be displayed, once it is swiped away. If another message is received from the same contact/number, a new notification should display the new message (or possibly the swiped away message and the new message). Device info.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

It would be very handy if I can enable SMS fallback only for the contacts in my country but disable them for contacts out of my country.

Statement: Request Number - 328 | Request Title - Feature request: Sending dummy short messages | Request Description - TextSecure could mask meaningful communication between people by occasionally sending dummy random messages to random recipients at random times:  Recipients would be chosen randomly between contacts that knowingly use TextSecure, so it could be recognized as such after decryption and automatically discarded by recipient. ""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns. People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number.

Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 937 | Request Title - Conversation View: Consistent message order | Request Description - Please correct me, but as far as I can tell, messages are sorted by time of arrival. However, since the messages are transported either via SMS or via Google Cloud Messaging, both of which don't guarantee ordering, messages may appear in the wrong order. This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messages #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)? Idea 2: Give each message a sequence number generated by the TextSecure server. Sort conversation view according to those numbers. Problem: Many, but not all messages go through the TS server. Idea 3: Employ vector clocks.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Statement: Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

It often happens that I want to share some pics with someone (more than just one pic), and I have to select them one at a time instead of selecting them all and sending them all at once. It would be cool if I could pick them from the gallery and then click ""share"" and send them without going through the procedure n times. I don't think this should be hard to implement and it would save so much time and improve usability greatly. Thank you

Statement: Request Number - 604 | Request Title - Number registration (for push messaging) doesn't work with Google Voice | Request Description - The new push based TextSecure doesn't seem to like using Google Voice numbers (which are then forwarded to my phone's real number via SMS).  Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.

I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

By way of contrast, holding down on a conversation in the Conversations list initiates Batch Selection Mode, allowing user to select multiple conversations for an action (currently Delete is the only option). Being able to trim out fluff from a conversation but keep important messages would be a valuable feature. A similar Batch Selection Mode for individual messages within a conversation (as already exists in the default Android Text Message app) would provide this functionality.

Statement: Request Number - 6424 | Request Title - Improve search for non-contacts | Request Description - We recently made some improvements in Signal-iOS around searching for non-contacts by phone number.  I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Statement: Request Number - 328 | Request Title - Feature request: Sending dummy short messages | Request Description - TextSecure could mask meaningful communication between people by occasionally sending dummy random messages to random recipients at random times:  Recipients would be chosen randomly between contacts that knowingly use TextSecure, so it could be recognized as such after decryption and automatically discarded by recipient. ""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns. People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number.

Statement: Request Number - 937 | Request Title - Conversation View: Consistent message order | Request Description - Please correct me, but as far as I can tell, messages are sorted by time of arrival. However, since the messages are transported either via SMS or via Google Cloud Messaging, both of which don't guarantee ordering, messages may appear in the wrong order. This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messages #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)? Idea 2: Give each message a sequence number generated by the TextSecure server. Sort conversation view according to those numbers. Problem: Many, but not all messages go through the TS server. Idea 3: Employ vector clocks.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites.

It often happens that I want to share some pics with someone (more than just one pic), and I have to select them one at a time instead of selecting them all and sending them all at once. It would be cool if I could pick them from the gallery and then click ""share"" and send them without going through the procedure n times. I don't think this should be hard to implement and it would save so much time and improve usability greatly. Thank you

Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.

I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! üéâ"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Statement: Request Number - 328 | Request Title - Feature request: Sending dummy short messages | Request Description - TextSecure could mask meaningful communication between people by occasionally sending dummy random messages to random recipients at random times:  Recipients would be chosen randomly between contacts that knowingly use TextSecure, so it could be recognized as such after decryption and automatically discarded by recipient. ""Randomness"" should be tweaked to level-out the legitimate messages, spoiling the traffic analysis of traffic retention data, preventing to weigh connections in the deducted social network graph or guessing sleeping/activity patterns. People often have many unused messages in their monthly quota, so those could easily be used with no extra cost, or they value their privacy more than some money. Sender would need to enable this feature (opt-in) and define desired quantity (eg max 100 dummy messages per month, 2 dummy messages for every legitimate one, max 500 messages total counting legitimate and dummy ones...). The feature would need to be aware of roaming (disabled by default, optionally enable) and battery level (do not send if bellow eg. 30%). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#Countermeasures Possible extensions:  Recipients could be able to let their peers know, that they do not want to participate in this and do not want to receive messages for whatever reason (opt-out). Recipients could also be chosen randomly between other contacts (those not using TextSecure yet) to promote its use (default message) or a custom explanation by sender. Those messages would be in clear text. As this might be annoying it should be very limited (eg max 1 message to a single recipient per month, only during daytime...) to not be too intrusive spam. Dummy messages could contain other peer's phone numbers (random selection from those participating in dummy messaging, not just their contacts), never to be shown to user, just to send dummy messages to, to further mask the real social network. It would be tricky to opt-out later on once your number starts circulating, so opt-outs would need to be spread this way as well and by direct reply dummy message or by defining a TTL of each such number.

Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 937 | Request Title - Conversation View: Consistent message order | Request Description - Please correct me, but as far as I can tell, messages are sorted by time of arrival. However, since the messages are transported either via SMS or via Google Cloud Messaging, both of which don't guarantee ordering, messages may appear in the wrong order. This means that chat participants may see deviating orders of messages, replies to messages they don't even see. In theory, it's even possible that several messages from the same sender arrive and are displayed in wrong order.  Idea 1: Sort the conversation view by ""sent"" timestamp. See also Display send date for incoming messages #806. Problem: What is the ""sent"" date? Is it reliable? Is it set by the client or the TS server (farm)? Idea 2: Give each message a sequence number generated by the TextSecure server. Sort conversation view according to those numbers. Problem: Many, but not all messages go through the TS server. Idea 3: Employ vector clocks.

Statement: Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. <a href=""signal://send?text=Hello%2C%20World!"">Send message to Signal Private Messenger</a> Read more about this here

It often happens that I want to share some pics with someone (more than just one pic), and I have to select them one at a time instead of selecting them all and sending them all at once. It would be cool if I could pick them from the gallery and then click ""share"" and send them without going through the procedure n times. I don't think this should be hard to implement and it would save so much time and improve usability greatly. Thank you

Statement: Request Number - 604 | Request Title - Number registration (for push messaging) doesn't work with Google Voice | Request Description - The new push based TextSecure doesn't seem to like using Google Voice numbers (which are then forwarded to my phone's real number via SMS).  Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.

I hope the bug belongs to this repo, sorry if not! For my use case, the 30s/.../1 week periods for disappearing messages are not useful. I quite often want to have a look at messages written within the last month. I'd thus not use the feature at all, even though in principle I think it is a good idea. I'd suggest to add further periods up to at least one year or something. (As I'm thinking of it, maybe it should even be 13 months rather than 12, so you can re-read what you were discussing on your last year's birthday or last christmas or whatever, and it only disappears little after) (Signal 3.19.1 on Android 6.0.1 / CM 13)

By way of contrast, holding down on a conversation in the Conversations list initiates Batch Selection Mode, allowing user to select multiple conversations for an action (currently Delete is the only option). Being able to trim out fluff from a conversation but keep important messages would be a valuable feature. A similar Batch Selection Mode for individual messages within a conversation (as already exists in the default Android Text Message app) would provide this functionality.

Statement: Request Number - 6424 | Request Title - Improve search for non-contacts | Request Description - We recently made some improvements in Signal-iOS around searching for non-contacts by phone number.  I suggest we have parity on Android.  Fix non-contact lookup for non-US users.¬†SignalServiceKit#130 Further refinements to phone number parsing.¬†SignalServiceKit#139 Let's say user has a US phone number like +12045002827.  They should be able to search for another US phone number like +17043264096 by entering any of:  +17043264096 17043264096 7043264096 They should also be able to search for a non-US phone number like +441733530267 by entering any of:  +441733530267 441733530267 IMO we should try prepending the calling code for the current user's phone number and the calling code that corresponds to the default region for the current device.  I'm not sure how this works on Android, but on iOS users specify their language and region preferences as a system setting.  So for a user living in the US (With a US phone number) but who is Scottish and like seeing dates and times, etc. formatted in UK way and thus uses the UK region, we should try both US and UK calling codes since they are likely to look up users in both places.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Statement: Request Number - 1692 | Request Title - sms delivery report: show received time in message details | Request Description - when a sms delivery report is received, the time the other user received the message (afaik the done date ) should be saved and it should be possible to view it in message details. This way one could see when the other user received the message (not only that is was received). edit: if someone can give me a hint where to look/start in the code to implement this, I'd try to make a pull request (but I just glanced through the code and cannot find a starting point ... maybe it's simply too late already ;-))

Statement: Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.
