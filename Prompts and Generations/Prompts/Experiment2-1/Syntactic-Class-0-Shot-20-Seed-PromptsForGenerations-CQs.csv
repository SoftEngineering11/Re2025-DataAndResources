Reason:  An ellipsis is a gap in a sentence cause by omission of a lexically or syntactically necessary constituent.
Elliptical ambiguity occurs when it is not certain whether or not a sentence contains an ellipsis. In this case, ""the same"" seems to be cut off and it is not clear the results is the same to what?
