Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

47,316-Signal,"Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Request Number - 778 | Request Title - Feature Request: Only one notification for multiple messages received at once + Timestamps | Request Description - After being offline (flight mode / no internet connection) my device rings/vibrates multiple times, depending on how many messages have been sent by others in the meantime. Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

Being in a quite active group my device vibrated for about 30 seconds this morning. I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.

I can see the point of being notified that not only one but multiple messages have been received but this should be reworked to a less annoying way (e.g., ring twice for multiple messages). Additionally, all messages that get then received are displayed with their receiving time. I would prefer having them displayed with the sending time, which can also be seen by looking in the message details. Maybe a menu entry to switch between both options would be a good idea because I can imagine people who like it the way it is handled now.

Reason: The term ""less annoying"" is subjective and vague. What constitutes ""less annoying"" may vary among users and cannot be measured using a specific metric.
