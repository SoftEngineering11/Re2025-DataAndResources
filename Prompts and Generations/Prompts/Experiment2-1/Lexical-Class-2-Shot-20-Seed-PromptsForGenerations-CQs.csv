Statement: Request Number - 6362 | Request Title - Visual display for how many contacts are on Signal | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  It'd be nice if Signal had a screen that would show e.g. a pie chart that indicated how many of my contacts were on Signal.

Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Statement: Request Number - 604 | Request Title - Number registration (for push messaging) doesn't work with Google Voice | Request Description - The new push based TextSecure doesn't seem to like using Google Voice numbers (which are then forwarded to my phone's real number via SMS).  Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.

Request Number - 520 | Request Title - Feature: Direct Photo/Video/Audio attachments while staying in app (API calls to camera, sound recorder, video camera) instead of multistep separate apps | Request Description - I love the app... I want to replace it full time from Textra, BUT there is a big draw back, why don't you allow for direct photos, video and sounds to be taken. So you don't have to use two apps to get the file to send. Example: My wife takes a photo of something she wants my opinion on buying, (in textra or native) presses add, camera comes up, takes photo and sends Example: Same situation, but with Text Secure you have to take the photo first and save image, then goto app and add via the menu of ""where"" the documents are to attach and send So, as you can imagine carrying on a conversation and needing to send several photos during that conversation it would be a bit frustrating and very time consuming using Text Secure. Native, Textra and about all others I have used use API's and directly use the photo/audio to send.

Reason: The highlighted term can sometimes be used as a technical term, but one or more of its original meanings also works in the given context, which creates multiple possible interpretations.

Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: ""real received time"" is ambiguous and can have multiple interpretations. 
####
Extracted Lexical ambiguity segment: real received time.

Statement: Request Number - 6362 | Request Title - Visual display for how many contacts are on Signal | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  It'd be nice if Signal had a screen that would show e.g. a pie chart that indicated how many of my contacts were on Signal. Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.
####
Reason: The word 'on' can have multiple meanings, which creates multiple interpretations of the sentence and feature request.

Is it the name of another app, an abbreviation for another app (and if so, what app), or something else?']","Lexical ambiguity: a word has multiple meanings, making its interpretation dependent on the context. It can arise in two forms: (1) when a word has  unrelated meanings despite sharing the same spelling and pronunciation, it is called homonym (e.g., ""bank"" as a financial institution vs. ""bank"" as the side of a river). These meanings originate from different etymology root (2) when a word has  related meanings that stem from a single etymology, it is referred to as Polysemy (e.g., ""green"" referring to the color and to something environmentally friendly).

Statement: Request Number - 604 | Request Title - Number registration (for push messaging) doesn't work with Google Voice | Request Description - The new push based TextSecure doesn't seem to like using Google Voice numbers (which are then forwarded to my phone's real number via SMS).  Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.
####
Reason: The word 'push' can be a technical term with a different meaning than its literal definition, creating multiple possible interpretations.
