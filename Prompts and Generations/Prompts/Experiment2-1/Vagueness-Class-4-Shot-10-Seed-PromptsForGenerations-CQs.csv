This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
