Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: The demonstrative pronoun ""this"" can point to multiple concepts in the context of the message, which creates alternative interpretations.

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.
