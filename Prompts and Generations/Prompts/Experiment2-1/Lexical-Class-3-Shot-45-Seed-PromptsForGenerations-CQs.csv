It would be far more convenient if the chat stayed where you left it/where the new received messages start and you could then just continue reading.

Request Number - 6362 | Request Title - Visual display for how many contacts are on Signal | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  It'd be nice if Signal had a screen that would show e.g. a pie chart that indicated how many of my contacts were on Signal. Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: ""real received time"" is ambiguous and can have multiple interpretations.

Request Number - 604 | Request Title - Number registration (for push messaging) doesn't work with Google Voice | Request Description - The new push based TextSecure doesn't seem to like using Google Voice numbers (which are then forwarded to my phone's real number via SMS).  Although there are of course privacy downsides associated with letting Google see all of your incoming/outgoing SMS data, there are also serious privacy harms associated with letting people know your actual phone number, rather than a number that will just forward texts to you* The first step of the TextSecure number registration process (""Connecting"") works fine. An incoming text message with the verification code is received by the default Android SMS app, but TextSecure doesn't catch it. Thankfully, after 2 minutes of waiting, I am given the opportunity verify by voice, which does work.
####
Reason: The word 'push' can be a technical term with a different meaning than its literal definition, creating multiple possible interpretations.
