Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

(sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way.

Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail).

Request Number - 6362 | Request Title - Visual display for how many contacts are on Signal | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  It'd be nice if Signal had a screen that would show e.g. a pie chart that indicated how many of my contacts were on Signal. Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top.

This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

88,7345-Signal,"Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.
####
Reason: The placement of ""without"" with ""and"" can cause two different grouping options which implies syntactic ambiguity.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer.

Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

122,7345-Signal,"Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.
####
Reason: The placement of ""without"" with ""and"" can cause two different grouping options which implies syntactic ambiguity.

Reason:  An ellipsis is a gap in a sentence cause by omission of a lexically or syntactically necessary constituent.
Elliptical ambiguity occurs when it is not certain whether or not a sentence contains an ellipsis. In this case, ""the same"" seems to be cut off and it is not clear the results is the same to what?

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer.

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

Reason: The placement of ""without"" with ""and"" can cause two different grouping options which implies syntactic ambiguity.

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 802 | Request Title - Feature Request: import and export keys to file, Bluetooth, QR, and NFC | Request Description - more specificly I'd like to be able to import and export the private key, and public keys to files. I'd also like to be able to import and export public keys via bluetooth, NFC, and QR code. Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Request Number - 6362 | Request Title - Visual display for how many contacts are on Signal | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  It'd be nice if Signal had a screen that would show e.g. a pie chart that indicated how many of my contacts were on Signal. Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way.

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer.

Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up.

I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.
####
Reason: The placement of ""without"" with ""and"" can cause two different grouping options which implies syntactic ambiguity.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Statement: Request Number - 7567 | Request Title - [Feature Request] SMS/Signal Notifications profile | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. When making Signal as default SMS manager, there is no way to have default SMS notification (Android settings) to be enforced and having the Signal notification settings just for Signal message/call only. Steps to reproduce.  Install Signal and enable SMS support. Actual result: The same Expected result: Use Android notification profile for regular SMS/MMS and use Signal settings for secure messages / call. I use Signal with a limited number of people and I wish to know the difference between regular SMS or secured one by the ringtone (secure messages are mostly more urgent than other SMS). Screenshots.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up.

One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.
####
Reason: The placement of ""without"" with ""and"" can cause two different grouping options which implies syntactic ambiguity.

I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

Elliptical ambiguity occurs when it is not certain whether or not a sentence contains an ellipsis. In this case, ""the same"" seems to be cut off and it is not clear the results is the same to what?

Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Or how many of the messages I send are encrypted. Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert. There's probably also room for some gamification in here - the app could display something like e.g. ""Almost there! __"" when most, but not all, of my contacts were using Signal.

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them.

Something like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain The do key management pretty well, for GPG. (sadly no one writes apps that use their wonderful app, but seriously, best key management app there is.) its also open source, I wonder if you could steal some code from them, and use their key management interface. Reasons I need this new phone, I need to securely wipe the old key, export the old key to a file, and then re-import it. Lost phone, in case I loose my phone, I can reuse the same gpg key. Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.

Statement: Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Tapping an element of the pie chart would then show a list of people in that category - this would be a nice way to get an overview of contacts I still need to convince to convert.
