Device immaterial - once I have a back up file of the private key, I can store that on an encrypted parition, or container, and bounce that around as I see fit between devices, PCs, internet storage, etc.. I can then bring it back when I need it. I can also switch between phones at will. For public keys. in addition to reasons 1-3, having a good back up of my friend's public keys, I can easily re-import them, and share them with other people as needed, to make the fewest amounts of key exchanges needed. I can set up phones for people with all the public keys they need. just load them up, and go. This would just make an already good app fucking awesome.
