Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

47,226-Signal,"Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: The demonstrative pronoun ""this"" can point to multiple concepts in the context of the message, which creates alternative interpretations.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.
####
Reason: The word used here may be a near homophone of the intended word, which would create a different meaning if so.

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

Request Number - 6069 | Request Title - Unread notification badges do not work on Huawei EMUI | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I've installed Signal on a Honor 8 (made by Huawei) with EMUI 4.1 (Android 6.0). I've noticed that Signal receives notifications on new messages and they are also listed in the notification area, but the unread notifications badge on the app icon on the home screen is not shown. In Signal support articles there is mentioned, that badge icons are supported for some launchers, see https://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/215766077-How-can-I-see-my-unread-badge-count-What-launcher-should-I-use- So far I could not find out if this is a Signal or EMUI problem, but Threema and Conversations show the notification badges. Device info. Device: Honor 8 Android version: 6.0 Signal version: 3.26.2

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Statement: Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Statement: Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world!

SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: The demonstrative pronoun ""this"" can point to multiple concepts in the context of the message, which creates alternative interpretations.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Reason: The word used here may be a near homophone of the intended word, which would create a different meaning if so.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

I've installed Signal on a Honor 8 (made by Huawei) with EMUI 4.1 (Android 6.0). I've noticed that Signal receives notifications on new messages and they are also listed in the notification area, but the unread notifications badge on the app icon on the home screen is not shown. In Signal support articles there is mentioned, that badge icons are supported for some launchers, see https://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/215766077-How-can-I-see-my-unread-badge-count-What-launcher-should-I-use- So far I could not find out if this is a Signal or EMUI problem, but Threema and Conversations show the notification badges.

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

Reason: The word used here may be a near homophone of the intended word, which would create a different meaning if so.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Request Number - 276 | Request Title - Saving Attachments - where do they go? | Request Description - This is hopefully a daft question, but I can't find the answer anywhere. I've received a nice picture via MMS into TextSecure 0.9.9.7. It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

Reason: The use of the word ""nonsense"" is incorrect in this context and likely a word choice or translation error.

Statement: Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
####
Reason: The demonstrative pronoun ""this"" can point to multiple concepts in the context of the message, which creates alternative interpretations.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.

This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic.

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.
####
Reason: The word used here may be a near homophone of the intended word, which would create a different meaning if so.

Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

459,316-Signal,"Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry.

Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

Statement: Request Number - 3446 | Request Title - Let me aggressively invite non-textsecure friends | Request Description - I just set Textsecure as my default SMS app on Android. Every time I send an unconventional SMS, I'd like to invite these users to install Textsecure/Signal, because I want more of my friends to be able to have private conversations with me. I also want Textsecure to spread organically because I think that'd be good for the world! I'd like a preference that would append short invite text and an invite link to every message provided there are enough characters, for example: ""Let's speak privately! SHORTLINK"" or ""Get privacy: SHORTLINK"" or ""Get this! SHORTLINK"" Ideally you'd experiment and figure out whatever text worked the best. For any user that sets their default SMS app as textsecure/signal, you should ask them if they'd like to turn this on.

Request Number - 7310 | Request Title - Feature: add support for custom url sceme signal:// so we can have share buttons | Request Description - [x ] searched open and closed issues for duplicates [x ] read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. I maintain a website, and I would love to put signal share buttons on my articles. To do so, there needs to be a way to point to the signal app from webpages. The manner to do this without many compatibility issues is a custom url sceme: signal:// I know, custom url scemes could be considered bad practice since they pollude the namespace. I agree, but for now signal can't compete with other social media from a buisness standpoint because of missing features like these. This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: It is unclear whether the highlighted text contains a grammatical error or unusual word ordering, which creates alternative interpretations when a reader attempts to mentally correct the potential error by replacing it with new text. This is also Syntactic-Other (Possessive ambiguity), however the choice of ordering implies the opposite possessive order than the expected meaning, which is why this is also being labeled Language Error.

I've noticed that Signal receives notifications on new messages and they are also listed in the notification area, but the unread notifications badge on the app icon on the home screen is not shown. In Signal support articles there is mentioned, that badge icons are supported for some launchers, see https://support.whispersystems.org/hc/en-us/articles/215766077-How-can-I-see-my-unread-badge-count-What-launcher-should-I-use- So far I could not find out if this is a Signal or EMUI problem, but Threema and Conversations show the notification badges. Device info. Device: Honor 8 Android version: 6.0 Signal version: 3.26.2

It looks okay in the message thread, and clicking it gives me the warning about needing to decrypt it, but then it loads perfectly into my image viewer. If I tap+hold the image, I'm then warned about needing to decrypt it to put it on the external SD card, it then takes maybe half a second while it says ""Saving attachment..."", and then ""Success"" flashes up. Despite all of this, I can't find the attachment anywhere on my phone :-( (I've used ES File Explorer to search for various filenames, but to no avail). I had a look in the source code; it looks like it's saving to Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), but none of the obvious locations seem to have the picture in them. Any idea where attachments end up? (If it matters, I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100 running Jellybean 4.1.2).

This may keep a lot of people from using signal as their favorite messenger app. (world domination is not the goal, but we don't want to shoot ourselfs in the foot either, private messaging will only happen if your contacts are also willing to accept signal on their phone.) Lets consider having share buttons on websites. A custom url sceme would be a good start to make that possible. Send message to Signal Private Messenger Read more about this here

Request Number - 226 | Request Title - Ability to edit messages for security | Request Description - My understanding of OTR protocol is that you are guarantied to be the sender of a message when it is received but the protocol also guaranties that nobody can prove a message was sent by you at a later point. Like a real life conversation. ""If know you said something to me, but I can not prove it at a later point"". This is great but unless TextSecure somehow allows people to alter the past of a conversation the app itself does provide a reasonable proof/indication that I said something in the past. Example: My friends phone is ceased and he is compromised to unlock TextSecure. OTR does not in any way guarantee I had our long conversation but since my friend is not a skilled hacker/developer able to alter the TextSecure database the conversation itself it a pretty good indicator/proof of the conversation being authentic. Solution: Add the option to edit a message (any message) from the Android Context Menu just like you can delete a message. Maybe also add the ability to insert a new message next to it.
