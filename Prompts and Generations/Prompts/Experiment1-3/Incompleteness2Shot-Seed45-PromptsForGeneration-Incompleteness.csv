One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button.

Statement: Request Number - 7345 | Request Title - Better Media Saving Behavior | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. One of the features that was missing for a long time but thankfully has been recently implemented was the ability to swipe through the images without having to keep going back to the index and always having it start at the top. Kudos and thanks for that. However, another element exists that can be greatly improved and probably just got missed; and hopefully can be added. Currently each picture (""media"") provides you the save button on the top. However, it never detects that the item has already been saved and you have to just remember it or go check your on device gallery to see if it is already there. Instead, it simply keeps making duplicates of the item and just incrementing it. It would't be too difficult to do a simple if/exists > show view/share icon else/doesn't > show save icon (as it is now). This will spare the need to save multiple duplicates and incrementing it when you can simply provide a visual check that it has already been saved. It is simply better UX and cleaner that way. Steps to reproduce.  save an item save it again you have a duplicate with a -1 at the end save it again you now have 3 with a -1 and -2 of the same item repeat and goes on as long as you keep saving Expected result: Detect that the item has already been saved and either provide a view icon or share icon to visually indicate it has been saved already, otherwise show the save button. A simple file system check for the item will facilitate this. Thanks in advance.

It would be very handy if I can enable SMS fallback only for the contacts in my country but disable them for contacts out of my country. Usually out-of-country SMS rates are quite high and can run up quite a bill if you have the feature enabled to fallback on SMS. Thanks.
