This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.

Statement: Request Number - 969 | Request Title - Color incoming messages in groups according to author | Request Description - Since there's so many UX experts around lately, I want to propose this: In groups, I always find it kind of annoying to have to read the name of the sender of a message. Somehow that distracts me from the actual messages. What do you think about this: In a group message, every incoming message is colored based on the author. Basically, we'd need a ""string to RGB"" hash function (shouldn't be that hard) and then color the background of their messages with 20% opacity (or so..) That way, I know that everything that's green is from my Buddy Bob, and everything that's yellow is from Alice, and I can just read the whole conversation without reading the name in front of every single message...

Statement: Request Number - 6390 | Request Title - Notify sender if Signal message has been sent but not delivered to recipient after some time | Request Description - I have:   searched open and closed issues for duplicates  read https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/wiki/Submitting-useful-bug-reports  Bug description. Recipients who are registered for Signal may not be able to receive secure signal messages due to reasons such as:  temporary unavailability of internet access (e.g. prepay plans with hard data caps; otherwise intermittent data connectivity) permanent unavailability having uninstalled Signal without first unregistering Neither of these are apparent to the sender, and sending a Signal message results in the message sitting on the server for some undefined length of time. The sender does not get notified that while their message has been sent to the server, it has not been delivered to the recipient, leading to frustration once the fact is discovered ( #6377 , #2285 (comment) etc). The status is available in conversation UI in the form of one tick vs two ticks, but this requires the sender to explicitly check back in the conversation UI. It would improve the user experience if a signal message that was sent but not delivered after some timeout (minutes?) triggered a ""lack of delivery"" notification on the senders phone along the lines of ""Your secure message to YYY could not be delivered after N minutes. Would you like to resend via insecure SMS?"" This way it is up to the user to explicitly fall back to the less secure protocol. (This notification proposal is orthogonal to but complementary to the ability of Signal to better remember the per-contact preference of transport channel suggested in #2285 , #845 (comment) etc. It would also serve as an easier to implement and more secure alternative to automatically falling back to SMS as suggested in #678 , #2847 , #3074 , #4009 , #5001 )

Voice messaging is one of the most popular features of Wazzapp, raise-to-speak  and raise-to-listen would make it much easier to use, even better than the competition!

Statement: Request Number - 312 | Request Title - Need Batch Selection Mode for individual messages inside a conversation | Request Description - Deleting individual messages from a conversation is cumbersome and inefficient (Hold down on a message, then select Delete from popup menu, then select Yes on confirmation message, one message at a time). By way of contrast, holding down on a conversation in the Conversations list initiates Batch Selection Mode, allowing user to select multiple conversations for an action (currently Delete is the only option). Being able to trim out fluff from a conversation but keep important messages would be a valuable feature. A similar Batch Selection Mode for individual messages within a conversation (as already exists in the default Android Text Message app) would provide this functionality.

Statement: Request Number - 2055 | Request Title - use delivery receipts to show message received time for outgoing messages | Request Description - After long pressing on a message and selecting the info button, the message details are shown. This includes the sent and received times for incoming messages. For outgoing messages, in contrast, only one Sent/Received time is displayed, probably containing sent time. Now that delivery receipts are implemented, it would be possible to display the received time for outgoing messages (by taking the sent time from the receipt). Or to make it more precise, let the receipt message piggybag the real received time. This would make the user interface more consistent. When this is rejected for some reasons, I suggest renaming the ""Sent/Received"" label for outgoing messages to ""Sent"" because this is what it really is about.
