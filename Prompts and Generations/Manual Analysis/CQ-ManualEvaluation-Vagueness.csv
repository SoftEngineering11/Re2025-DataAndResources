Request Number - 316 | Request Title - Feature request: Allow sharing Android calendar events via TextSecure | Request Description - Originally a bug, which should have been titled ""Shared calendar events are not actually attached."" The fix in #1025 removed TS from the ""share with"" list of calendar events, so no longer a bug, but would like to be able to share calendar events via TS, same as can be done with default Android text app. Original (bug) text: Android default Calendar app lets you send a calendar entry. TextSecure is one of the apps that comes up as an option to use for sending. Choosing it, you get to TextSecure, but there is no attachment, just an empty message. (If you choose the regular default Android Text Messaging app, the calendar entry does get properly attached, which is why I suspect the issue is with TextSecure.) Only tried doing this from Calendar, don't know if it's an issue sending via TextSecure from other apps.
####
Reason: Properly is vague, and there is no way to evaluate it using a measure.
